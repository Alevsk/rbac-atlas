## Description

Allows updating the status of CertificateSigningRequests (CSRs). This could be abused to prematurely mark CSRs as 'Approved' or 'Denied', potentially bypassing approval workflows (if the approver is weak or misconfigured), blocking legitimate certificate issuance, or causing general confusion. Does not grant approval itself if an approver is required.
