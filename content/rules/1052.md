## Description

Grants the ability to approve CertificateSigningRequests (CSRs). This is extremely critical as approving a CSR for a user or group with high privileges (e.g., system:masters group) allows an attacker to mint a client certificate that grants them those privileges, leading to full cluster compromise.

## Abuse Scenarios

1. Approve a pending CertificateSigningRequest.

```bash
kubectl certificate approve <csr-name>
# Example: kubectl certificate approve my-user-csr

```
