## Description

Allows managing PriorityLevelConfiguration objects cluster-wide. These are part of API Priority and Fairness, defining concurrency limits and queueing for API requests. Misconfiguration can lead to denial of service against the API server by starving critical requests or by setting unfair limits, impacting cluster stability.
