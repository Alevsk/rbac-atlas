## Description

Grants permission to delete nodes from the cluster. This can lead to a severe denial of service by removing compute capacity, disrupting running applications, and potentially causing data loss for workloads not designed for sudden node disappearance.

## Abuse Scenarios

1. Delete a specific node from the cluster.

```bash
kubectl delete node <node-name>
# Example: kubectl delete node minikube

```
