## Description

Permits viewing, listing, watching, or deleting CertificateSigningRequests. Viewing CSRs can disclose information about pending certificate requests. Deleting CSRs can cause denial of service by preventing legitimate certificates from being issued or renewed.

## Abuse Scenarios

1. List all CertificateSigningRequests.

```bash
kubectl get csr

```

2. Delete a specific CertificateSigningRequest, preventing certificate issuance.

```bash
kubectl delete csr <csr-name>
# Example: kubectl delete csr my-app-csr

```
