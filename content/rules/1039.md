## Description

Permits creating, updating, or deleting CronJobs across all namespaces. CronJobs schedule recurring batch jobs. This is critical as it allows scheduling the execution of pods (potentially privileged) at regular intervals, leading to privilege escalation, persistent access, and tampering.
