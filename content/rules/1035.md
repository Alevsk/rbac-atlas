## Description

Permits creating, updating, or deleting DaemonSets across the cluster. DaemonSets ensure a pod runs on all (or selected) nodes. This is highly critical as it allows deploying privileged pods directly onto every node, leading to widespread node compromise, privilege escalation, and persistent access.
