## Description

Allows managing Lease objects across all namespaces. Leases are used for leader election by control plane components and controllers. Tampering with leases can disrupt critical cluster operations, cause denial of service, or potentially force a malicious controller to become a leader.

## Abuse Scenarios

1. List all Lease objects across all namespaces.

```bash
kubectl get leases --all-namespaces

```

2. Delete a critical Lease object (e.g., for a controller), causing disruption.

```bash
kubectl delete lease <lease-name> -n <namespace>
# Example: kubectl delete lease kube-controller-manager -n kube-system

```
