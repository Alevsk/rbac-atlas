## Description

Allows a user/service account to use a specific PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) that may grant excessive privileges (e.g., hostPath mounts, privileged mode). If the PSP is overly permissive, this leads to direct privilege escalation by creating pods that use it. (Note: PSPs are deprecated in 1.21 and removed in 1.25).
