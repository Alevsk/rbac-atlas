## Description

Permits modifying existing pods in any namespace across the cluster. This is critical as an attacker can alter a pod's specification to grant it elevated privileges (e.g., change image, add privileged security context, mount sensitive host paths), leading to code execution, privilege escalation, and tampering with running workloads.
