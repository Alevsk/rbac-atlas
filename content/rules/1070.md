## Description

Allows reading all events across all namespaces. Events can reveal sensitive operational information, error messages, pod creation/deletion activity, image names, and other details that could aid an attacker in reconnaissance or identifying vulnerabilities.

## Abuse Scenarios

1. List all events across all namespaces.

```bash {copy=true}
kubectl get events --all-namespaces

```

2. Watch events in real-time across all namespaces.

```bash {copy=true}
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --watch

```
