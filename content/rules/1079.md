## Description

Allows creating, updating, or deleting PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs) cluster-wide. Maliciously configured PDBs (e.g., setting maxUnavailable to 0 for critical components) can prevent voluntary disruptions, or conversely, allow too many disruptions, leading to denial of service or impacting application availability.
